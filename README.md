# Chat_with_Local_Documents
This project is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to chat with their local documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The app integrates LangChain, ChromaDB, and Ollama (with a local deepseek-r1:8b model) to retrieve relevant document chunks and generate contextual answers.
